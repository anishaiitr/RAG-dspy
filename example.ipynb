      "\n",
      "2. Cancer Coverage:\n",

      "\n",
      "3. Premium Waiver Benefits:\n",
      "- PRU Health Critical Illness Extended Care III offers premium waiver benefits for early stage major disease claims and all future premiums after a major disease claim.\n",

      "\n",
      "4. Family Protection:\n",
      "- PRU Health Critical Illness Extended Care III includes special protection for families, such as extra life protection for the first 10 years when two family members are covered under the plan.\n",

      "\n",

      "6. Benefit Protector Option:\n",
      "- PRU Health Critical Illness First Protect II offers the Benefit Protector Option, allowing policyholders to increase their protection by 5% of the initial sum assured every year, up to 200% of the initial sum assured.\n",
